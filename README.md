# JavaScript-Arrays
This repository is for learning the basics of JavaScript arrays.

- Arrays are lists that store data in JavaScript.
- Arrays are created with brackets [].
- Each item within an array is located at a numbered position, or index, starting at 0.
- We can access one item in an array using its index, with syntax like: myArray[0].
- We can also change an item in an array using its index, with syntax like myArray[0] = 'new string';
- Arrays have a .length property, which allows you to see how many items are in an array.
- Arrays have their own methods, including .push() and .pop() , which add and remove items from an array, respectively.
- Arrays have many methods that perform different tasks, such as .slice() and .shift()
- Some built-in methods are mutating, meaning the method will change the array, while others are not mutating. You can always check the documentation.
- Variables that contain arrays can be declared with let or const. Even when declared with const, arrays are still mutable. However, a variable declared with const cannot be reassigned.
- Arrays mutated within a function will keep that change even outside the function.
- Arrays can be nested inside other arrays.
- To access elements in nested arrays, chain indices using bracket notation.
